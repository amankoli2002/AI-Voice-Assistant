# AI Voice Assistant

A simple AI voice assistant built using modern technologies that can interact with users via voice commands. This project demonstrates the integration of speech-to-text conversion, natural language processing (NLP), and text-to-speech functionalities. It is developed using Expo for mobile app development and integrates various APIs for voice processing.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Converts spoken words into text using the AssemblyAI API.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Provides spoken responses to user queries.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Responds intelligently to user inputs using the Cohere API for text generation.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface to interact with the assistant.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Expo (React Native)
- **Voice-to-Text API**: [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com/)
- **Text Generation API**: [Cohere API](https://cohere.ai/)
- **Backend**: (if applicable, e.g., Node.js, Django)
